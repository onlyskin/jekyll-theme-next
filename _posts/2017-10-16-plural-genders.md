Polish verbs usually agree with their SUBJ noun in person and number. In the past tense,
they also agree in gender. In the singular, there are three possible gender agreement markers:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>m.</td>
    <td>-ł</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>f.</td>
    <td>-ła</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n.</td>
    <td>-ło</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When in the plural, I used to think that masculine gender words changed to `-li`, and
feminine gender to `-ły`.

Today I learnt that this is partly true, but not 100% correct, and definitely not the
whole story! It turns out that in the plural, the gender agreement system for Polish
verb-noun agreement differentiates two classes/genders: human-male and non-human-male
(replace human-male with SWCM and you have a reflection of the real world)...

Anyway, in practise this means that for plural we have:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>m. human</td>
    <td>-li</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>other</td>
    <td>-ły</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Practically, the weird thing is that this means that if you have a plural form of a
masculine gender noun, the verb that agrees with it would take the (I always thought)
'feminine' form -ły, which actually is a catch-all 'other' form, as such:

masculine singular: 
`czerwony samochód był ...`

masculine plural:
`czerwone samochody były ...`

neuter singular:
`dziecko było ...`

neuter plural:
`dzieci były ...`

## Grammar

I've made the table below to try to show the overall division for verb agreement
with gender in the past tense, maybe other people will find it helpful, maybe not:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>s.</td>
    <td>pl.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(nauczyciel, lekarz)</td>
    <td>m. human</td>
    <td rowspan="2">był</td>
    <td>byli</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(pies, samochód)</td>
    <td>m. other</td>
    <td rowspan="3">były</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(kobieta, herbata)</td>
    <td>f.</td>
    <td>była</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(dziecko, okno)</td>
    <td>n.</td>
    <td>było</td>
  </tr>
</table>
